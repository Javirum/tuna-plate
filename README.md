> Internal Ironhack Barcelona Hackathon (UX/UI + WebDev)

# What is this?
Landing page developed for the first Ironhack's Hackaton. We had to create a landing page for a fictional company called “Superfoods.Inc” that aims to increase the consumption of vegetables on teenager's.

The landing page had to be built following the concept of their marketing campaign: "Bleet don't kale my vibe". For our landing page we created a character that we called Bro-coli, so we could connect with the marketing campaign.

- Designed for mobile

- Team: Laura Feliz (UX/UI), Charles Beranguer (UX/UI), Paula Balcells (Web development) and Javier Romero (Web Development)
